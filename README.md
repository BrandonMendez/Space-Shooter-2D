# Space-Shooter-2D
This is the first assignment given by the Introduction to Game Development class (COMP376) from the Universiry of Concordia.
It is a 2D space shooter clone where the player must fend off 30 seconds of different waves of enemies before having to fight an incredibly hard boss.
This is my very first untiy project.
